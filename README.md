🌦️ Weather App
A responsive, real-time weather application built with JavaScript that fetches and displays current weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. This project demonstrates skills in API integration, DOM manipulation, and client-side error handling.

🧩 Features
🔍 Search weather by city name

🌡️ Displays temperature, weather status, humidity, and wind speed

🌄 Dynamic icons and backgrounds based on weather

🔁 Error handling for invalid cities or failed requests

⚙️ Responsive layout (mobile-friendly)

⚙️ Tech Stack
Layer	Tools Used
Frontend	HTML, CSS, JavaScript
API	OpenWeatherMap API
Icons	Font Awesome / Weather Icons (optional)
Hosting	GitHub Pages / Netlify

🚀 How It Works
User enters a city name in the search box.

JavaScript sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.

API returns weather details in JSON.

The app dynamically updates the UI with weather data.

🔐 API Key Setup
Replace YOUR_API_KEY in script.js with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.

Edit
const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
📈 Future Enhancements
🌍 Add geolocation to auto-detect user location

🗓️ Show 5-day forecast using the forecast API

🌙 Light/dark mode toggle

📦 Store last searched cities in localStorage

🌐 Backend proxy for secure API key handling

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
